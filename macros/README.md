## Overview

Create your own macros, scripts that help you automate your routine tasks and standardize documents. 

ONLYOFFICE macros use JavaScript language syntax and ONLYOFFICE [Document Builder API scripting notation](https://api.onlyoffice.com/docbuilder/basic). 

You can add your own macros to documents, edit and save them.

## How to use the plugin

3. Enter your script code and click “Run” to run it within the document.

## How to use VBA-based macros in ONLYOFFICE

Macros written in Visual Basic won’t be compatible with ONLYOFFICE. You can rewrite your old macros to make them work in ONLYOFFICE. 

Use our [API documentation](https://api.onlyoffice.com/plugin/convertingvbamacros?_ga=2.126654729.589713290.1580285135-699576329.1539952318) to learn how to convert macros.
