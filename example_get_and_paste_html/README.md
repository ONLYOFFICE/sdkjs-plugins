## Overview

Get your document content as HTML code, modify it, and paste back to the document. 

This plugin uses [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net), a versatile text editor implemented in JavaScript for the browser.

The plugin is compatible with [self-hosted](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DocumentServer) and [desktop](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DesktopEditors) versions of ONLYOFFICE editors. It can be added to ONLYOFFICE instances manually. 

## How to use

1. Open the Plugins tab and press "Get and past html".
2. Select the necessary content.
3. In the plugin field on the left panel, you'll see the HTML code of the selected abstract.
4. Modify the HTML code if necessary.
5. Click "Paste into document" to insert the HTML code to the current cursor position in your document. 

You can also write your own HTML code (without selecting any document content) and then paste it to your document. 

## How to install
